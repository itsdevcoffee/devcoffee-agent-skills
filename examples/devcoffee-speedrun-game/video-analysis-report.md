## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Scanline Intensity (Optional Enhancement)**
**Current State:** Scanlines are very subtle (appropriate for modern displays)
**Observation:** CRT effect is present but minimal - adds authenticity without distraction
**Suggestion:** Consider offering "CRT intensity" slider for users who want more pronounced effect
**Priority:** Low - Current implementation is tasteful and appropriate
**Impact:** Aesthetic preference only, not a quality issue

### 2. **Character Animation Detail (Minor)**
**Current State:** Player sprites are small but functional at current scale
**Observation:** Walk cycles and animations exist but are subtle at 32x32 pixel size
**Suggestion:** Could add 1-2 more animation frames for walk/jump cycles for slightly smoother motion
**Priority:** Low - Current animation works well for gameplay clarity
**Impact:** Polish enhancement, not critical for video success

### 3. **Transition Frame Timing (Minor)**
**Current State:** Frame 2 catches mid-transition with minimal visual context
**Observation:** Character select screen transitions quickly to next scene
**Suggestion:** Hold character select screen (with portraits visible) for 0.5-1 second longer
**Priority:** Low - Only one transition moment caught in sampling
**Impact:** Gives viewers more time to appreciate character select design

### 4. **Boss HP Indicator Consistency (Minor)**
**Current State:** Monolith boss (Frame 6) has clear 3-bar HP indicator; Boss bug (Frame 9) HP less visible
**Observation:** May be off-screen in HUD or positioned differently
**Suggestion:** Ensure both bosses have equally visible HP indicators in same style
**Priority:** Medium - Consistency enhances professional feel
**Impact:** Small UX improvement for viewers tracking boss battles

### 5. **Particle Effect Visibility (Unable to Verify)**
**Current State:** Static screenshots cannot capture motion-based particle effects
**Observation:** Code shows ParticleEmitter implementation for explosions and collectibles
**Suggestion:** Ensure particles are visible in motion (duration 15-30 frames, bright colors)
**Priority:** N/A - Likely working correctly in full video
**Impact:** Adds visual polish and feedback for player actions

### 6. **Power-Up Animation (Enhancement)**
**Current State:** Pink star power-up in Frame 8 is static and glowing
**Observation:** Very eye-catching and desirable, accomplishes goal
**Suggestion:** Add subtle rotation or pulse animation for extra visual interest
**Priority:** Low - Current design is effective
**Impact:** Small enhancement to already excellent design
